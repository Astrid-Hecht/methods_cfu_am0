# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    * Maybe like 6/10? I know how to use the ones i'm familiar with, but I feel like there're 10000 more left to learn

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
    * Pretty confident! Theres a few high concept things I'm still trying to figure out, but I plan on doing my own research

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
    * So today we saw methods being used by calling on objects (Ex: object.method) and by passing parameters into the method's arguments. What's the difference? How is "this is string".reverse different than reverse("this is string")?
